Land and access to it is in limited supply, they stopped making it.  Hence the motivation for this project.  This project is a launch finder for windsurfers, and can be extended to other watercraft.  It shows you where the launches and public access points are, gives a description of the launches, so you can plan ahead and avoid aimlessly searching for a place to launch your craft.
